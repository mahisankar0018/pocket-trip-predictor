# Pocket Trip Predictor – Trip Cost Calculator

This repository contains **Pocket Trip Predictor**, a browser-based trip cost estimator for Indian routes.

It supports:
- From / To / Via locations
- Distance lookup using OSRM + OpenStreetMap
- GPS-based current location (browser geolocation)
- Destination weather using Open-Meteo
- Driving (car/bike) and flying cost estimation
- Stay, food, extras and per-person total
- Theme toggle and localStorage state persistence

This is intended as an academic mini-project combining **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** on the front-end,
with equivalent business logic also implemented in **Java** for course outcome (CO) mapping.

To host as a static site, you can use GitHub Pages: place `index.html` at the repository root and
enable Pages with the `main` branch and root folder.
